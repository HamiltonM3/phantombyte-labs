## Overview

An experimental research effort investigating whether generative methods can improve the breadth and efficiency of AI security testing inputs. The project is focused on expanding evaluation coverage and improving testing quality in a controlled, research-oriented setting.

## Problem Statement

Manual adversarial prompt construction is skilled, time-consuming work. Coverage is inherently limited by the creativity and time available to the tester. This project explores whether generative approaches — specifically GAN-inspired methods — can systematically produce higher-coverage adversarial inputs for AI security evaluations.

## Approach

The experiment investigates:

- Whether a generator/discriminator dynamic can be applied to adversarial prompt construction
- How to define meaningful "success" signals for adversarial prompts in a security testing context
- What safeguards are needed to ensure outputs remain within a controlled research setting
- How generated inputs compare to manually crafted ones in terms of coverage and novelty

## Current Status

Prototype / Experimental. This is early-stage research. Initial experiments are focused on understanding the feasibility of the approach before any broader development.

## Note

This work is conducted in a strictly controlled research context focused on improving security testing capabilities.
