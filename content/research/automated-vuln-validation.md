## Overview

A research project exploring how AI-driven workflows can help security teams validate vulnerabilities and prioritize response more efficiently. The goal is to improve decision-making by producing clearer, evidence-based outcomes that support remediation and operational coordination.

## Problem Statement

Security teams are often overwhelmed by the volume of vulnerability findings from scanners and assessments. Triage is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently disconnected from operational context. This project asks: can agentic AI systems reliably take on structured validation tasks and produce outputs that meaningfully improve response quality?

## Approach

The research explores agentic workflows that can:

- Ingest raw vulnerability findings from multiple sources
- Validate findings against target context (exploitability, exposure, asset criticality)
- Produce prioritized, evidence-backed remediation guidance
- Support handoff to human analysts and operational teams with clear audit trails

A key design principle is that AI outputs augment human decision-making rather than replace it — the system is built to increase clarity and reduce noise, not to operate autonomously in high-stakes remediation decisions.

## Current Status

Active research. Initial workflow designs are being tested against controlled vulnerability datasets.
